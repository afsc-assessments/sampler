# Yellowfin sole sampler

## Case specific functions

sampler_YFS.R has calls to do the following things, 

  1. read in lengths, ages, and catch by pre-defined strata
	2. create input files for "sam" (see sam.tpl in src directory)"
	3. run the model
	4. process the results.

Presently there isn't a facility to do directly from the ORACLE tables so modifications are needed there.
